# Lending Club Case Study
>Bank has to decide patterns from existing loan applicants. 
Two types of risks are associated with the bankâ€™s decision:
1.   If the applicant is likely to **repay the loan**, then not approving the loan results in a **loss of business to the company**
2.   If the applicant is **not likely to repay the loan**, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a **financial loss** for the company
